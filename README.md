# Averaging Filtration
Averaging filtration of 3D cloud points

Steps:
  1. Creating triangulation
  2. Finding edges
  3. Measuring distances
  4. Filtration
  5. Plotting results
  6. Export results

In pdf files you can find information about 3D cloud creation.  
The main file is ["main.py"](https://github.com/trojanskehesten/averaging_filtration/blob/master/main.py) which takes functions from file ["averaging_filtration.py"](https://github.com/trojanskehesten/averaging_filtration/blob/master/averaging_filtration.py).  
For testing algorithm you can use my examples (txt files) or please yours with the same format of text data.
